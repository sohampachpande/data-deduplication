# data-deduplication

Repo for the data deduplication project. 

### Problem Statement

“The presence of duplicates can potentially dilute the signal strength that one can extract from the column for ML” [1] which can affect the accuracy of models trained on the data. To mitigate this loss, we aim to study the statistical features of data and duplicate category points, and build a model for detecting categorical duplicates in a table.
